## üíº **Key Technical Skills Demonstrated**

### **Backend Development Excellence**
```php
// Clean, maintainable code architecture
class TaskScheduler {
    private function processScheduledTasks(): array {
        return $this->atomicFileOperations()
                   ->validateInputSecurity()
                   ->executeWithErrorHandling();
    }
}
```

### **System Architecture & Design Patterns**
- **MVC Separation**: Clear separation between presentation, business logic, and data layers
